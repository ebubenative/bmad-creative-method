# Creative Elicitation Methods

This document outlines various methods used by the BMAD Creative Method agents to elicit information, feedback, and inspiration from clients and stakeholders.

## 1. The Creative Briefing Workshop

-   **Objective:** To collaboratively fill out the Creative Brief and ensure all stakeholders are aligned on the project's goals.
-   **Method:** A structured workshop facilitated by the Creative Strategist. The agent will guide the client through the `creative-brief-tmpl.yaml`, asking open-ended questions to stimulate discussion and uncover deep insights.
-   **When to Use:** At the very beginning of any new project.

## 2. Mood Board & Style Scape Sessions

-   **Objective:** To define the visual direction of a project in a collaborative and visual way.
-   **Method:** The Art Director will present a curated set of mood boards or style scapes, each representing a different creative territory. The agent will then facilitate a discussion with the client, asking them to react to the visuals and articulate what they like and dislike.
-   **When to Use:** During the visual exploration phase of a project.

## 3. The "Five Whys" for Feedback

-   **Objective:** To get to the root of a piece of feedback and understand the underlying strategic issue.
-   **Method:** When a client gives a piece of subjective feedback (e.g., "I don't like that color"), the agent will respectfully ask "Why?" up to five times to move beyond personal taste and uncover the real concern (e.g., "It doesn't feel premium enough for our brand").
-   **When to Use:** During any client review or feedback session.

## 4. Brand Personality Sliders

-   **Objective:** To define a brand's personality in a simple, quantifiable way.
-   **Method:** The Creative Strategist will present a series of spectrums (e.g., "Playful to Serious," "Modern to Classic," "Mass-Market to Luxury") and ask the client to place the brand on each spectrum.
-   **When to Use:** During the brand strategy phase of a new brand identity project.

## 5. Co-Creation & Sketching Sessions

-   **Objective:** To involve the client directly in the creative process and generate ideas collaboratively.
-   **Method:** (Requires human participation) The Art Director or a designer agent will facilitate a live sketching session with the client, translating their ideas into rough visual concepts in real-time.
-   **When to Use:** For complex problems or when the client has a strong creative vision they are struggling to articulate.

## 6. A/B & Multivariate Testing

-   **Objective:** To get quantitative data on creative effectiveness.
-   **Method:** For digital projects, the agents can propose and help set up A/B or multivariate tests to compare different creative executions on key metrics like click-through rate or conversion.
-   **When to Use:** For performance-driven projects like digital advertising or website design.
