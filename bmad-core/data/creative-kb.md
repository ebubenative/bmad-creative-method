# BMAD Creative Method - Knowledge Base

This document is a central repository of creative knowledge, principles, and best practices that inform the BMAD Creative Method.

## Core Creative Principles

-   **Strategy First:** All creative work must be grounded in a clear and compelling strategy. We do not design for decoration; we design for purpose.
-   **The Power of the "Big Idea":** We believe in the power of a single, powerful, organizing idea to drive a creative execution.
-   **Audience-Centric:** We design for the audience. Deep empathy and understanding of the target user is at the heart of everything we do.
-   **Aesthetic Excellence:** We are committed to the highest standards of craft and execution. We believe that beauty and effectiveness are not mutually exclusive.
-   **Clarity and Simplicity:** We strive to make the complex simple and the message clear.
-   **Cultural Relevance:** We believe that the best creative work reflects and contributes to contemporary culture.
-   **Iterative Collaboration:** We believe in a collaborative process of creation, review, and refinement.

## Key Frameworks & Methodologies

-   **Design Thinking:** A human-centered approach to innovation that integrates the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.
-   **The Double Diamond:** A model for the creative process that maps the divergent and convergent stages of design.

-   **Brand Archetypes:** Using universal patterns of storytelling to build authentic and resonant brand personalities.

## Technical Best Practices
