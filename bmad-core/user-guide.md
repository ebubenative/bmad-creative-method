# BMAD Creative Method - User Guide

Welcome to the BMAD Creative Method, a comprehensive framework for managing and executing creative projects with excellence. This guide will walk you through the core concepts and how to get started.

## Core Concepts

### The Maestro Agent
Every new project in the BMAD Creative Method starts with the **Maestro** agent. This agent acts as your personal project setup assistant. Through a simple series of questions, it will help you:
- Define your project's primary goal.
- Select the optimal workflow for your needs.
- Assemble the perfect team of AI agents.
- Kick off the first task to get your project rolling.

To start a new project, simply invoke the Maestro: `bmad-agent exec maestro kickoff`

### Creative Workflows
The BMAD Creative Method is built on a series of pre-defined workflows, each tailored to a specific type of creative project. These workflows are designed to guide you through the entire creative process, from initial strategy to final delivery. Some of our core workflows include:
- **Brand Identity Development:** For creating new brands from the ground up.
- **Campaign Creation:** For developing integrated marketing and advertising campaigns.
- **Digital Product Design:** For designing websites, apps, and other digital experiences.
- **Content Creator:** For managing social media and content creation.

### Agent Teams
Each workflow is supported by a team of specialized AI agents. These agents are experts in their respective fields, such as creative strategy, art direction, copywriting, and video production. They will execute the tasks in your chosen workflow, collaborating with you and each other to produce high-quality creative work.

## Project Types

We have two primary project types, each with its own approach:

### ðŸ”µ Blue Sky Projects
This is for brand new creative endeavors where you are starting with a blank canvas. This could be a new brand, a new product, or a new campaign with no pre-existing creative constraints. Our "Blue Sky" workflows are designed to maximize creativity and exploration.

### ðŸŸ  Brand Evolution Projects
This is for projects where you are working with an existing brand or creative assets. This could be a brand refresh, a new campaign for an established product, or extending a brand into a new market. Our "Brand Evolution" workflows are designed to ensure consistency while still pushing the creative boundaries.

## Getting Started

1.  **Initiate a New Project:** Open your terminal and run `bmad-agent exec maestro kickoff`.
2.  **Answer the Maestro's Questions:** The Maestro will guide you through the setup process.
3.  **Collaborate with Your Agent Team:** Once the project is set up, your AI agent team will begin executing the workflow. They will prompt you for input, feedback, and approvals at key stages.
4.  **Review and Iterate:** Use the Q-Score rubric to provide structured feedback and guide the creative to a world-class outcome.

Welcome to the future of creative work. Let's make something amazing together.
