## Overview

**BMAD Creative Method's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Agentic Strategy & Onboarding:** A dedicated **Maestro** agent collaborates with you to understand your project goals, recommends the optimal workflow, and assembles the perfect team of creative agents. This ensures every project starts with a clear, strategic foundation.

**2. Context-Engineered Creativity:** The system then uses a series of specialized agents (Creative Strategist, Art Director, Copywriter, etc.) to execute the creative workflow. Each agent is provided with the full context of the project, eliminating context loss and ensuring that every creative execution is strategically sound and creatively brilliant.

This two-phase approach eliminates both **strategic misalignment** and **context loss** - the biggest problems in creative development. Your creative team starts every project with a deep understanding of what to create, how to create it, and why.
