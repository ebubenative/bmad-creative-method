# BMAD Creative Method - Expansion Packs

The BMAD Creative Method is designed to be a powerful and flexible core for any creative project. However, we recognize that some creative disciplines have highly specialized needs. That's where Expansion Packs come in.

## What are Expansion Packs?

Expansion Packs are add-ons to the `bmad-core` that provide specialized agents, workflows, templates, and knowledge bases for a specific creative domain. They seamlessly integrate with the core system, allowing you to tailor the BMAD Creative Method to your exact needs.

## Available Expansion Packs

While the `bmad-core` is comprehensive for most creative projects, we are developing a series of specialized Expansion Packs, including:

-   **Game Design & Development:** A complete framework for designing and developing 2D and 3D games, with specialized agents for game design, level design, and narrative design.
-   **Architectural & Environmental Design:** A specialized workflow for architectural visualization, environmental graphic design, and experiential design projects.
-   **Film & Episodic Content:** A framework for developing, producing, and post-producing long-form video content.
-   **Industrial & Product Design:** A specialized workflow for the physical product design lifecycle, from concept sketching to prototyping and manufacturing.

## Creating Your Own Expansion Pack

The BMAD Creative Method is designed to be open and extensible. If you have a specialized creative discipline that you'd like to build a framework for, you can create your own Expansion Pack.

A typical Expansion Pack includes:
-   A `config.yaml` file that defines the pack's metadata.
-   A set of specialized `agents`.
-   A series of domain-specific `workflows`.
-   A library of custom `templates` and `checklists`.
-   A dedicated `data` directory for a domain-specific knowledge base.

By building on top of the `bmad-core`, you can leverage the power of the core system while creating a tailored solution for your unique creative field.
