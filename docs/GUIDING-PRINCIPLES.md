# BMAD Creative Method - Guiding Principles

These are the core principles that guide the BMAD Creative Method. They are the foundation of our approach to creative work.

## 1. Strategy is the Foundation of Great Creative
We believe that world-class creative work is not born from random inspiration, but from a deep understanding of the business problem, the audience, and the cultural context. Every creative decision we make is grounded in a clear and compelling strategy.

## 2. The "Big Idea" is Everything
We believe in the power of a single, powerful, organizing idea to cut through the noise and connect with audiences on an emotional level. We are relentless in our pursuit of the "Big Idea" that will drive a project's success.

## 3. Human-Centered Creativity
We design for people. Our process is built on a foundation of empathy and a deep understanding of the needs, desires, and motivations of the target audience. We believe that the most effective creative work is that which resonates on a human level.

## 4. Excellence in Craft
We are committed to the highest standards of craftsmanship in everything we do. From the kerning of a headline to the timing of an animation, we believe that attention to detail is what separates good creative from great creative.

## 5. Collaboration is Our Superpower
We believe that the best ideas are born from collaboration. Our framework is designed to foster a seamless partnership between our AI agents and our human users, combining the power of machine intelligence with the nuance of human creativity.

## 6. An Iterative Path to Perfection
We don't believe in "big reveals." We believe in an iterative process of creation, review, and refinement. Through frequent check-ins and structured feedback, we guide the creative work to a place of excellence.

## 7. Continuous Learning & Evolution
Our framework is not static. With every project, we learn and evolve. Our post-mortem workflow is designed to capture insights and continuously improve our process, ensuring that we are always at the forefront of creative best practices.
